📊 **Data Analytics Learning Portfolio**

This repository contains my practical work completed while learning Data Analytics. The notebooks and Power BI file demonstrate my hands-on practice in data handling, analysis, and visualization.



📚 **What I have learned**
Through this course, I have learned to:

- Use Python for data analysis
- Work with NumPy for numerical computing
- Clean and manipulate data using Pandas
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Analyze real-world datasets
- Build basic relationships and dashboards in Power BI
